*Understanding Performance of Long-Document Ranking Models through Comprehensive Evaluation and Leaderboarding*, 

Leonid Boytsov, Tianyi Lin, Fangwei Gao, Yutian Zhao, Jeffrey Huang, Eric Nyberg.

All the models except neural Model 1 (which we were not able to release due to patenting/licensing issues) are implemented in our [FlexNeuART framework](https://github.com/oaqa/FlexNeuART/tree/pypi2021), currently it is not the branch `pypi2021`, not the main branch! The framework is used out-of-the-box and provides documentations regarding indexing collections and training the models. However, we will soon publish more detailed instructions including model configurations and some training data.
